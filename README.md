# calendar

Simple Gregorian calendar for printing and hanging on the wall.

Before printing, you can select the year, configure the page layout (1 or 2 months per page), and configure the month/weekday headers.

Currently not hosted anywhere but it's a single HTML file with self-contained JS so you can just download it.

## Todo

* Allow the week to start on a different day.
* Shade the weekends.
* Add moon phases.
* Most months have 5 rows in the calendar, but some have 6 (needs "two days in one square") and some have 4 (like February 2026).
